# @harpua/agent-tools

Framework-agnostic prebuilt [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs)
tools for agents. Each tool is a plain `tool()` instance, so it drops into any
LangChain / LangGraph TypeScript app — a `ToolNode`, `createReactAgent`,
`bindTools`, or your own executor. The package depends only on
`@langchain/core` and `zod` (both peers): no NestJS, no LangGraph runtime.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @harpua/agent-tools
# peers you almost certainly already have:
pnpm add @langchain/core zod
```

## Tools

### `thinkTool(options?)`

The Anthropic-style [think tool](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool):
a no-op scratchpad the model calls to record reasoning between tool calls. The
handler returns an empty string — nothing executes; the thought is simply logged
for the model's own benefit. Useful before an irreversible action, when policies
conflict, or when a tool result is surprising.

```ts
import { thinkTool } from "@harpua/agent-tools";
import { ToolNode } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";

// Vanilla LangGraph: mount it in a ToolNode like any other tool.
const toolNode = new ToolNode([thinkTool()]);
```

Tune the when-to-think guidance per domain by overriding the description:

```ts
const think = thinkTool({
  description:
    "Think before cancelling or refunding: confirm the order state and that " +
    "the customer's request matches policy.",
});
```

`options` is validated with zod (`{ description?: string }`, unknown keys
rejected). The tool's input schema is `z.object({ thought: z.string() })`.

## Using with `@harpua/langgraph`

[`@harpua/langgraph`](../langgraph) accepts these tools directly in a graph's
`tools` array, mixed freely with its own `@LangGraphTool` provider classes:

```ts
import { LangGraph, defineEdges, START, TOOLS, END } from "@harpua/langgraph";
import { thinkTool } from "@harpua/agent-tools";

@LangGraph({ name: "agent", state: AgentState, tools: [OrderTools, thinkTool()] })
export class AgentGraph {
  edges = defineEdges<AgentState>([
    { from: START, to: CallModel },
    { from: CallModel, to: route<AgentState>(shouldContinue, [TOOLS, END]) },
    { from: TOOLS, to: CallModel },
  ]);
}
```

The raw tool is mounted into the same `ToolNode` and traced with a
`langgraph.tool think` span like any DI-bound tool.
